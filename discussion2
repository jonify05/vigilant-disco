The research questions from the assigned study on youth violence are all logical extensions of the stated study’s purpose, and represent the best questions that address the research problem of youth violence. The research questions centered on whether victimization was higher for minority ethnic groups, for females over males, or for people from differing socio-economic positions (Hishinuma, Chang, Goebert, Helm, Else, & Sugimoto-Matsuda, 2015, p. 229). The study incorporated a quantitative methods approach to research and relied on self-reporting for behavioral and demographical survey data (pp. 232-233). The inferential questions sought to compare groups involved in the phenomenon of youth violence and followed the hypotheses that females and minority groups were most often the victims of violence. The research identified participants and location, highschool students and O’ahu, respectively (p. 229).
